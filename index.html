        <li><strong>Device and diagnostics</strong> - device model, operating system version, app version, crash reports, performance logs, and coarse analytics such as feature usage counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> - actions within the app such as opening features, number of sessions, and basic interaction telemetry. This is aggregated or pseudonymous.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not require your legal name, address, or phone number to use the app. You may choose to provide contact details for support.</p>

      <h3>2. How we use information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain core features including chat responses, mood tracking, tarot reader, horoscope, and dream interpretation.</li>
        <li>Protect the app from fraud, abuse, and security threats, and troubleshoot crashes or bugs.</li>
        <li>Analyze aggregated usage to improve reliability, accessibility, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests that you initiate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. AI processing</h3>
      <p>When you use AI features, the text you enter is transmitted to a third party AI service provider acting as our processor. Inputs are used only to generate a response and to protect the service from abuse. Prompts are sent over HTTPS. Providers are required to handle data under confidentiality and security obligations. Provider retention practices may vary. If you prefer to avoid any cloud processing, do not use the chat, tarot, horoscope, or dream interpretation features.</p>

      <h3>4. Storage and security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most data is stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes local data.</li>
        <li>We do not operate a public cloud database for AURA-BREE at this time. If this changes in the future, this policy will be updated before the change takes effect.</li>
        <li>We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Sharing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not sell your personal data.</li>
        <li>We share data only with service providers that help operate the app, such as AI processing and crash reporting, and only for the limited purpose of providing the service.</li>
        <li>We may disclose information if required by applicable law or to protect the rights, safety, or integrity of users and the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Retention</h3>
      <p>Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Transient data sent to our processors is retained only as long as necessary to provide the feature and meet security and legal obligations described by those processors.</p>

      <h3>7. International transfers</h3>
      <p>Service providers may process data in jurisdictions outside your region. Where applicable we rely on standard contractual clauses or similar safeguards.</p>

      <h3>8. Your rights</h3>
      <p>Depending on your region you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing of your information. To exercise rights contact us at <a href="mailto:james@godsimij-ai-solutions.com">james@godsimij-ai-solutions.com</a>. We may need to verify your request.</p>
